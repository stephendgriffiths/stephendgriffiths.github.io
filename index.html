<h1> Stephen Griffiths </h1>
<p>
I am a lecturer in the <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths">School of Mathematics</a> at the <a
href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk">University of Leeds</a>. Here, I study the
fluid dynamics of atmospheres and oceans, within the Astrophysical and
Geophysical Fluids research group. Although I have more general
interests in fluid dynamics and applied mathematics, much of my
present research work is targeted towards modelling waves (e.g.,
equatorial waves, internal waves, internal tides) and instabilities
(rotating shear instabilities, and the influence of magnetic
fields). I also collaborate with scientists in the <a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-climate-atmospheric-science">Institute for
Climate and Atmospheric Science</a> in the <a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see">School of Earth and
Environment</a>.
